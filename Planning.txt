Need a 'cell' object.
We will init:
    Number of nearby mines as 0
    Bomb cell as false
We need the following methods:
    Set as bomb
    Somehow lock a cell if flagged
    Reveal. This will then call the nearby reveal function if it is blank


Need some kind of recursive function to reveal nearby cells
